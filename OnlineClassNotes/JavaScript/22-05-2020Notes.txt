1. Inline
2. Embeded
3. External File
    - JavaScript functions are defined in a separate
      external file.
    - JavaScript files will have the extention ".js"
    - So that you can link the file to any HTML page and 
      access the functions from any page.
    - Using an external file will increase the number of
      requests for page and also the page load time.

Ex:
 1. Add a new file into project by name
	"print.js"
       function Printing() {
         window.print();
       }
2. Goto HTML page and link script file.

  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Demo</title>
        <script src="print.js">
          
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
        <button onclick="Printing()">Print Page</button>
    </body>
</html>

JavaScript MIME Type:
===================
- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- It specifies the media type of file.
- <script> element can be used for both server side and client side script.
- It is important to define the MIME type of <script> so that browser can easily understand the type.
- JavaScript MIME type can be defined as
	"text/javascript"
	           (or)
	  language="JavaScript"

Ex:
<script src="print.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
                                     (or)
<script src="print.js" language="JavaScript"> </script>

JavaScript for Legacy Browsers:
===========================
- Legacy browsers are OLD version browsers
- OLD version browser can't understand the new features and unable to identify several JavaScript functions and scripting techniques.
- Legacy browser can handle only upto HTML 4 and ES3.
	     "Differential Loading"
  It is a technique where library will be differentiated and loaded according to browser i.e legacy and modern.

Ex:
<script type="text/javascript">
           <!--
            function Printing() {
                window.print();
            }
            -->
</script>

JavaScript Strict Mode:
===================
- Every Programming language have specific coding standards to follow.
- JavaScript follows ECMAScript Standards
- Developers may violate the coding rules while writing the code.
- Strict Mode will not allow the code that is not according to standards.
- You can turn on JavaScript strict mode by using
	"use strict";

Ex:
  <script type="text/javascript">
           "use strict";
           function f1() {           
              x = 10;	  // Error: x - not defined 
              document.write("x=" + x);
           }
           f1();
        </script>

Note: In strict mode we have to declare a variable
	var x;
	x = 10;
