Primitive Types
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null

		Undefined
- It is a type defined for variables where value is not defined.
- Compile uses "undefined" as type for variable that are not defined with value.
- You check whether value is defined or not by using "undefined" keyword.

Ex:
<script type="text/javascript">
 function f1() {
     var name = "Samsung TV";
     var price;
     if(price==undefined) {
         document.write(`Name=${name}`);
     } else {
     document.write(`Name=${name}<br>Price=${price}`);
     }
 }
 f1();
</script>
		Null Type
- Null is a type defined for variable when value is not defined during time.
- Variable is not supplied with a value during runtime and you are trying to use the variable. Then it returns null.
- Null is an exception type used to tell that there is no value.
- You can verify the Null type by using the keyword "null".

Ex:
<script type="text/javascript">
 function f1() {
    var name = prompt("Enter Name");
    if(name==null) {
        document.write("You canceled..");
    } else if(name=="") {
        document.write("Name can't be Empty");
    } else {
    document.write(`Hello ! ${name}`);
    }
 }
 f1();
</script>

	        Non-Primitive Types
- Non Primitive types used memory heap.
- Memory heap is cache memory of borwser.
- They are stored in memory heap.
- They don't have any fixed range for value.
- The value range will change according to the available memory.
- JavaScript non-primitive types are
	1. Array
	2. Object
	3. Regular Expression

	               Array Type
	              ==========
- Arrays in computer programming are used to reduce overhead and complexity.
- Arrays reduce over head by storing values in sequential order.
- Arrays reduce complexity by storing multiple values under one name.
- Arrays can store various types of values. Some technologies have problem in allocating different types of memories in sequential order. Hence they restricted array to store same type of value.
- JavaScript array can handle any type of value.
- JavaScript array is not similar type of values.
- JavaScript array size can be changed dynamically.
- Array in JavaScript will have the behavior of  stack, queue, hashtable [dictionary collection] etc..
- Array allows to access from any location i.e the elements are accessbile in random.
