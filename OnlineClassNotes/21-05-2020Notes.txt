How do we know JavaScript enabled or Not in a Browser?
A. You can use HTML element <noscript>

Ex:
<body>
        <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
        <noscript>Please Enable JavaScript on your browser.</noscript>
</body>

How to integrate JavaScript into HTML Page?
A. JavaScript can be used in HTML page 
	a) Inline
	b) Embeded
	c) External File

Inline Technique:   In this method javascript functions are written for every element individually. You can't reuse the functions.

Ex:
<body>
        <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
       <button onclick="window.print()">
	Print Page 
       </button>
</body>

Embeded:  In this method the javascript functions are defined within the page by using <script> element. So that you can access and re-use the functions.

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Demo</title>
        <script>
            function Printing() {
                window.print();
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
        <button onclick="Printing()">Print Page</button>
    </body>
</html>
