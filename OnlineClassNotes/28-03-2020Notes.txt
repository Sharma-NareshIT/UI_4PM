Note: 
- A developer is provided with both CSS Original file and CSS Minified file.
- Don't use the minified file directly in Development, you have to use the minified files in Production.
- In Development always use Original file.
- If there is any error in minified file you can't track the error location easly.

   Original File	: for Development
   Minified File	: for Production

CDN : 
- Content Distribution Network
- Sometimes we have to use a CSS or JS file across several projects.
- Downloading and storing in every project is burden for project.
- We can maintain a remote server where we can store all our CSS and JavaScript files.
- So that we can access them directly from server without downloading into project. This is called as CDN.

Ex:
1. Open IIS
2. Create a new Virtual Directory by name "CDN"
	C:\CDN
3. Open Notepad
4. Type the following code
	h2{
	background-color:red;
	color:white;
	text-align:center;
	}
5. Save in website "styles" folder
	C:\CDN\Styles\effects.css
6. You can link the Remote CDN file in head section

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://localhost/cdn/styles/effects.css">
