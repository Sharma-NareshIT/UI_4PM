		Styles
- HTML Tags have limited set of attributes, which can't make the presentation exactly how the client wants.

- Styles will provide additional attributes, which can applied to HTML tags and Elements to make the presentation more interactive and also responsive.

- Styles are defined in HTML page by using 3 different methods

	a) Inline Styles
	b) Embeded Styles
	c) CSS [Cascade Style Sheet]

Inline Styles:
===========
- The style attributes are defined to any HTML element with in the Element related tag.
- The "style" attribute is used for defining styles.

   Syntax:
    <h2  style="attribute1:value; attribute2:value">
                       Your Text
    </h2>
- Inline styles are faster in applying effects to element as it present within the element tag.
- Inline styles can't be re-used for other elements.
- They are individual for specific element tag, we can't re-use.

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Inline Styles</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2 style="background-color: darkcyan; color: white; text-align: center;">HTML</h2>
        <h2>Java Script</h2>
        <h2>JQuery</h2>
    </body>
</html>

Embeded Styles:
==============
1. In this method the style attributes are written within <style> element and kept in a page.
2. You can keep in <head> section.
3. You can keep in <body> selection.

     <head>
        <style>
            selector {
	attribute1 : value;
	attribute2 : value;
	}
        </style>
     </head>

4. Styles in <head> section are recomended, when we want to load styles into memory on page request and use those style later.

5. Styles in <body> section are recomended when we want the styles to apply to elements immediately on page load.

6. Styles can be re-used.
7. Styles you defined can be accessed and used to other elements in the page, without re-writing.
8. Emebed is slow when compared to inline.

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Embeded Styles</title>
        <style>
            h2 {
                background-color: green;
                color:white;
                text-align: center;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <h2>Java Script</h2>
        <h2>JQuery</h2>
    </body>
</html>

CSS : [Cascade Style Sheet]
- Styles are maintained in a separate "stylesheet" and they are cascaded with our HTML page.
- Stylesheets are present in the background of HTML page. And their effects are visibile from the foregroud in HTML page.
- Styles are separated from Markup
- Styles can be re-used across several pages.
- Using External file for styles will increase the number of requests for page and also page load time.
- Stylesheets are maintained in a separate file that have the extention ".css".
- Stylesheets are linked to HTML page by using
	<link> element

Ex:
1. Create a new folder by name
	"Styles"
2. Add a new file into styles folder by name
	  "effects.css"
h2{
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}
3. Goto your HTML page and link the stylesheet

<head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../Styles/effects.css">
</head>
